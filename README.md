# Kent Hack Enough 2016 submission

TODO:
- Gmail app to scrape emails for assets linking to websites in alexa top 2000
- If assets link to accredited websites, and other assets link to spam sites, the email is a phishing attempt
- For less sophisticated phishing emails, students can flag them as potential phishing. Flags are sent to CIT, and sites can be added to a local phishing list so students can't access them. Can potentially be spread out if product is licensed to multiple universities, colleges, schools, businesses, etc.

Program as is does nothing, but Chrome loads it and it is now able to support the Gmail API, which I am too tired to figure out how to use. Oauth2 authentication has been obtained and there is a place for it on the Chrome webstore.
